This is a basic portfolio of my works. The portfolio contains my name, a little about my professional history, a clickable link to the github repository for the first assignment I completed for SMU's coding bootcamp, a random password generator I made, a Javascript quiz i made, and my contact infomation.
this readme has been updated to include the information about the Javascript quiz i made.
