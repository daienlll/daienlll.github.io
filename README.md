This is a basic portfolio of my works. My friend who had finished SMU's data science bootcamp infromed me that I could make the portfolio deployable using Github pages, hence the repository name. The portfolio contains my name, a little about my professional history, a clickable link to the github repository for the first assignment I completed for SMU's coding bootcamp, and my contact infomation.
