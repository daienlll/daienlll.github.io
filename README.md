This is a basic portfolio of my works. The portfolio contains my name, a little about my professional history, a clickable link to the github repository for the first assignment I completed for SMU's coding bootcamp, a random password generator I made, a Javascript quiz i made, a Workday Scheduler I made, and my contact infomation.
this readme has been updated to include the information about the Workday Scheduler i made.
this Workday Scheduler uses Day.JS and an If/Else to apply the past, present, or future classes to the timeblocks.
