            <p>To be, or not to be? That is the question—

                Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                
                The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
                
                Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
                
                And, by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep—
                
                No more—and by a sleep to say we end
                
                The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
                
                That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation
                
                Devoutly to be wished! To die, to sleep.
                
                To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,
                
                For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
                
                When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
                
                Must give us pause. There’s the respect
                
                That makes calamity of so long life.
                
                For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
                
                Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
                
                The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,
                
                The insolence of office, and the spurns
                
                That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,
                
                When he himself might his quietus make
                
                With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
                
                To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
                
                But that the dread of something after death,
                
                The undiscovered country from whose bourn
                
                No traveler returns, puzzles the will
                
                And makes us rather bear those ills we have
                
                Than fly to others that we know not of?
                
                Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
                
                And thus the native hue of resolution
                
                Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
                
                And enterprises of great pitch and moment
                
                With this regard their currents turn awry,
                
                And lose the name of action. —Soft you now,
                
                The fair Ophelia! —Nymph, in thy orisons
                
                Be all my sins remembered. <br>  - Hamlet.</p>
